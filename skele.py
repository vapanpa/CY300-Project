Comments:

This is a sample skeleton for a space blaster game. The overall game has been broken 
into smaller tasks (functions) that need to be peformed. While most of the 
functions are stubs and don't do anything at this point, the comments, parameter
lists, and return values (or the lack of a return value, in the case of "pass"
statements) show what they would do and how they would work. 


Space blaster is a basic spaceship shooting game in which a ship is piloted 
using a mouse-directed heading and thrusters initiated with the space bar.  The
ship is capable of firing at enemies that appear randomly on the screen and 
bounce back and forth.  The skeleton currently defines the important game features
and primary functions.  This will be expanded to include power ups, boss enemies,
and changes in the background with each level change. 

The skeleton currently displays the ship, a sample bullet, and the alien to the 
screen, along with the score.  All elements are static.  Additionally, 
variables used for maintaining and altering game state have been defined at the 
top of the file.  

The project team includes CDTs Sulley and Wakowski.  No additional modules other
than pygame zero are required to complete this project.
